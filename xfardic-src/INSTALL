The simplest way to compile xFarDic is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure --prefix=/usr' to configure the package for your system.  
     If you're using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need 
     to type `sh ./configure --prefix=/usr' instead to prevent `csh' from 
     trying to execute `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile xFarDic .

  3. Type `make install' as root user to install xFarDic. On Ubuntu based
     systems you can use `sudo make install' command.
  
Build Requirements
=====================
You should have wxGTK 2.8.x devel files installed before
compiling xFarDic. Get it from http://www.wxwidgets.org.

Other needed packages are:

1. aspell-dev
2. libxml2-dev
3. libgnome-desktop-dev
4. libnotify-dev
5. libsqlite3-dev
6. libespeak-dev

On Debian/Ubuntu issue following command to install required libs:

# apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev libaspell-dev libxml2-dev libgnome-desktop-dev libnotify-dev libsqlite3-dev

ESpeak Build Note
=====================
Atleast ESpeak 1.29 is needed to use/build xFarDic without problem. 
If you do not have ESpeak headers installed, or an old version is
available, disable TTS support using --with-speaklib=no configure 
switch:

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --with-speaklib=no
