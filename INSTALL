The simplest way to compile xFarDic is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure --prefix=/usr' to configure the package for your system.  
     If you're using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need 
     to type `sh ./configure --prefix=/usr' instead to prevent `csh' from 
     trying to execute `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile xFarDic .

  3. Type `make install' as root user to install xFarDic. On Ubuntu based
     systems you can use `sudo make install' command.
